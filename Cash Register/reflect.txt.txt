	What I leanrt while doing this workshop is that programming can be very hard and irritating. For you to get the code running correct, you need to be as detailed as possible. I also learnt how to do modulus devision and to type cast. The type cast is so powerful and it could change a variable from an interger toi a flaoting value.
	What I found intresting is i have an idea how the cashier registry works. It was fun to play with numbers and do the calculations. What i found hard was putting together all the calculations plus gst to make the program work exactly as needed. It was difficult to figure out the divisions and how to remove the decimals to get an integer value for quarters and dimes abd then get the balance back to float values of the money owing.
	It is best to convert floating point values to integers when performing arithmetic operations because it makes the math easier to undertand and calculate.It is also best to use modulusoperator rather than division and subtraction to find reminder because it is easier and you type less codes and you get the accurate value.
