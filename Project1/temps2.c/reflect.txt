\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this workshop, I did learn how to use an array structure and how to store data of common type. I also learnt more about iteration and that you must declare the average and tempi and temple to null in order to break the loop. I also learnt in detail how the while loop works. This workshop was very challenging especially the fact that I had to study for the midterm and other classes midterms as well. Almost everything about this workshop was challenging but interesting as well.\
